# War_Card_game


I developed this game as a part of my Python Bootcamp.
This game involves Object Oriented Programming concepts.
This game involves 2 players who are given equal number of cards from a well shuffled deck. 
Each Player then drops of of their card and compares to other player. 
Player whose card holds higher value takes all the cards on the table. 
Incase the cards placed by the players are of same value WAR condition arises.
In WAR condition each player has to drop 5 cards as part of war commitment. 
If a Player is unable to drop 5 cards, other player wins.
In case both players are unable to dro 5 cards, Player with greater number of cards wins.
If both player can afford the war then the 5 cards dropped by each player are compared on the values.
If the War condition arises again similar pattewrn is followed. This is done in order for the game to terminate in less number of rounds.
